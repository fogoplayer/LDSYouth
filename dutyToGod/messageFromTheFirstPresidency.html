        <h2>Message From the First Presidency</h2>
        
        <p>You live in a day of great opportunities and challengesâ€”a day
        in which the priesthood has been restored. You have the authority
        to administer the ordinances of the Aaronic Priesthood.
        As you prayerfully and worthily exercise that authority, you
        will greatly bless the lives of those around you.</p>
        <p>This book, along with the scriptures and For the Strength of
        Youth, will help you fulfill your responsibilities.</p>
        <p>Heavenly Father has great trust and confi dence in you and has
        an important mission for you to fulfill. He will help you as you
        turn to Him in prayer, listen for the promptings of the Spirit,
        obey the commandments, and keep the covenants that you
        have made. You will feel a great sense of accomplishment as
        you fulfill your duties, and you will be prepared to receive the
        Melchizedek Priesthood, receive the covenants and ordinances
        of the temple, worthily serve a full-time mission, and become a
        righteous husband and father. May the Lord continue to bless
        you in these efforts.</p>

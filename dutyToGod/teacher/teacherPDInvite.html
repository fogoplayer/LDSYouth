        <h2>Invite All to Come Unto Christ</h2>
        
        <h4>Learn</h4>
        <p>Read Doctrine and Covenants 20:53.
        As part of your duty to “watch over
        the church always, and be with and
        strengthen them,” you will now have
        the opportunity to serve as a home
        teacher. Discuss with your quorum
        president, your parents, or your home
        teaching companion what you could
        do to become a good home teacher.</p>
        <p>Read Alma 17:2–3, 9, and write what the sons of Mosiah did
        to prepare themselves for missionary service. Consider ways
        you can follow their example.</p>
        <p>Continue your efforts to share the gospel. Think about
        family members and friends whom you could invite to come
        unto Christ. Write their names and what you will do to help
        them (such as inviting them to a Church activity or giving
        them a copy of the Book of Mormon or a Church magazine).</p>
        
        <h2>Act</h2>
        <p>My plan to become a good home teacher:</p>
        <div contentEditable="true" class="textArea" id="teacherPDInvite1"></div>
        <p>Names of people and how I will help them come unto Christ:</p>
        <div contentEditable="true" class="textArea" id="teacherPDInvite2"></div>
        
        <h2>Share</h2>
        <p>▪ After following through with your
        plans, share with a parent or quorum
        leaders the experiences you have had
        serving as a home teacher and sharing
        the gospel. Talk about how these
        experiences are helping you prepare
        to become a full-time missionary.</p>

        <h2>Pray and Study the Scriptures</h2>
        
        <h4>Learn</h4>
        <p>Think about your personal prayers.
        How often do you pray? How do
        you feel when you pray? Study
        James 1:5–6; Alma 34:17–28; 3 Nephi
        18:15–21; and Moroni 10:3–5. Identify
        principles that can help make your
        prayers more meaningful and the
        blessings that will come as you “pray always.”</p>
        <p>Carefully study Helaman 3:29–30 and Doctrine and
        Covenants 18:33–36; 84:85. As you study, look for words and
        phrases that describe:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>How you should approach your study of the scriptures
          and words of the living prophets.</li>
          <li> Blessings that will come as you study the scriptures and
          words of the living prophets.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>On the next page, write your plan to improve your personal
        prayers and scripture study during your years as a teacher.
        Your scripture study could include the words of the living
        prophets in the conference issues of the Ensign or Liahona.</p>
        
        <h4>Act</h4>
        <p>My plan for strengthening my habit of regular prayer and scripture 
        study:</p>
        <div contentEdiable="true" class="textArea" id="teacherSSScriptures"></div>
        
        <h4>Share</h4>
        <p>Share what you are learning from your scripture study. For
        example, you could share with your family, with friends, in
        seminary, or in quorum meetings. Try to make sharing what
        you are learning a regular practice.
        This will strengthen your testimony
        and help you learn how to teach the
        gospel. It will also strengthen the
        testimony of others.</p>

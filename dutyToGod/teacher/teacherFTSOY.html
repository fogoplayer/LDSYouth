        <h2>For The Strength Of Youth: Education</h2>
        
        <p>After you have begun working on your plans in “Spiritual
        Strength” and “Priesthood Duties,” create a project based on the
        standards in the “Education” section of For the Strength of Youth.
        Use the steps on the following pages as a guide. Your project
        should be challenging and should include a signifi cant time
        commitment. It should also be based on your own needs and interests.
        It should help you establish a pattern of lifelong learning.</p>
        
        <h4>Step One: Learn</h4>
        <p>To learn about the importance of gaining
        knowledge, study the section titled
        “Education” in For the Strength of Youth
        and Doctrine and Covenants 88:77–80,
        118. Identify from these verses (a) what
        the Lord wants you to learn, (b) why
        He wants you to learn, and (c) how He
        wants you to approach learning.
        Read “The Family: A Proclamation to
        the World,” and identify your role as a
        future husband and father (see page 107
        of this book).</p>
        <p>Write your answers to the following
        questions, and discuss them with your
        parents or quorum members:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>What are the benefi ts of gaining an
          education?</li>
          <li>How will gaining an education
          help you fulfi ll your priesthood
          duties (including as a missionary,
          as a husband, as a father, and in
          your service to others)?</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h4>Step 2: Create a Project</h4>
        <p>Create a project that will help you apply what you have
        learned about gaining an education. It should include two
        parts: (1) plans to gain an education and (2) plans to explore future
        occupation options. Have a parent or leader approve your
        project before you begin working on it. Here are some examples
        of things you could include in each part of your project:</p>
        
        <h5>Examples-Education</h5>
        <ol>
          <li>Make a list of things you do well in school. Then make a list
          of things you could do to be more successful in school. Do
          those things, and note the difference it makes in your performance,
          your attitude about school, and so on</li>
          <li>Make a plan to gain an education or training. Consider
          including in your plan what schools you would like to attend
          or training you’d like to receive. Also include what you have
          to do to be admitted to your school or training program and
          what options exist to fi nance this education.</li>
          <li>Pick a topic you’re interested in that you aren’t learning in
          school, and research that topic independently. Share what
          you learn in a presentation or a written paper.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h5>Examples-Occupation</h5>
        <ol>
          <li>Learn about occupations or careers that interest you. This
          might include touring job sites and interviewing people who
          work there.</li>
          <li>Visit a local LDS employment resource center, and talk to a
          staff member about some of the future occupations or careers
          you are considering. Ask him or her what you would need
          to do to get a job in those fi elds. Share what you learn in a
          quorum meeting or Mutual activity.</li>
          <li>If you have income, develop and follow a personal savings
          and spending plan. It should include paying tithing and saving
          money for a mission. Share your plan with your parents
          or quorum members</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h5>My Project</h5>

        <h4>Step 3: Report Your Experiences</h4>
        <p>In the space below, write what you have learned from carrying
        out your project and how it has prepared you for your future
        responsibilities. Report on your experiences to your family or
        quorum members.</p>

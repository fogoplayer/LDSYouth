        <h2>Serve Others</h2>
        
        <h4>Learn</h4>
        <p>Contrast Nephi’s attitude with that
        of Laman and Lemuel as they responded
        to assignments (see 1 Nephi
        2:16–18; 3:1–7, 28–31; 4:1–2; 17:7–19,
        50–51; 18:1–4). In the space below,
        write several phrases from your study
        that represent the attitude we should have when fulfi lling
        responsibilities. Consider sharing your list with members of
        your quorum.</p>
        <div contentEditable="true" class="textArea" id="teacherPDServe1">Example: "Let us be faithful" (1 Nephi 4:1)</div>
        <p>With your quorum, discuss opportunities you have to serve
        others (ask your bishop or quorum leaders for ideas). List
        some specifi c things your quorum will do to give service.
        Also plan several things you will do on your own to give
        service, including service to members of your family.</p>
        
        <h2>Act</h2>
        <p>My quorum’s plan to give service:</p>
        <div contentEditable="true" class="textArea" id="teacherPDServe2"></div>
        <p>My personal plan to give service: </p>
        <div contentEditable="true" class="textArea" id="teacherPDServe3"></div>
        
        <h2>Share</h2>
        <p>Share with a parent, leader, or quorum
        members some of your experiences
        serving others. For example, you
        could talk about how your service has
        affected the people you have served
        and how your attitude has affected
        your experiences. You could also
        talk about how these experiences are
        helping you serve Jesus Christ (see
        Matthew 25:35–40) and become more
        like Him.</p>

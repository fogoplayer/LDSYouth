            <h2>About</h2>

            <p>The Lord has said that every priesthood holder should “learn his duty” and “act . . . in all diligence” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107.99">D&C 107:99</a>). This section will help you learn and fulfill your duties as a teacher, which are outlined in <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.53-59">Doctrine and Covenants 20:53–59</a>; <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84.111">84:111</a> and which include all the duties of a deacon (listed <a href="/LDSYouth/dutyToGod/deacon/deaconPDAbout.html">here</a>). Your duties can be organized into three groups:</p>

            <h4>Administer Priesthood Ordinances</h4>
            <p>Teachers prepare and pass the sacrament.</p>

            <h4>Serve Others</h4>
            <p>Teachers assist the bishop in “administering . . . temporal things” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107.68">D&C 107:68</a>). This may include gathering fast offerings, caring for the poor and needy, caring for the meetinghouse and grounds, serving as a messenger for the bishop in Church meetings, and fulfilling other assignments from the quorum president.</p>

            <h4>Invite All to Come unto Christ</h4>
            <p>Teachers are to “watch over the church always, and be with and strengthen them” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.53">D&C 20:53</a>). One way to do this is by serving as a home teacher. Teachers also “see that there is no iniquity in the church, neither hardness with each other, neither lying, backbiting, nor evil speaking; and see that the church meet together often” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.54-55">D&C 20:54–55</a>). This responsibility includes being a peacemaker, being an example of moral integrity and uprightness, and inviting others to attend church.</p>
            <p>They continue to “warn, expound, exhort, and teach, and invite all to come unto Christ” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.59">D&C 20:59</a>). This includes setting a good example, fellowshipping quorum members and others, speaking in Church meetings, sharing the gospel, and bearing testimony</p>

        <h2>Pray and Study the Scriptures</h2>
        
        <h4>Learn</h4>
        <p>Ponder the following questions, and
        consider writing your answers in a
        notebook or study journal:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>What effect do consistent prayer
          and studying the scriptures have
          on (a) your ability to keep the
          commandments? (b) your relationship
          with your family? (c) your
          relationship with God?</li>
          <li>What scripture passages are especially meaningful to
          you? Why?</li>
          <li>What specific things did you learn from the living
          prophets in the most recent general conference? How has
          following this counsel blessed you?</li>
        </ol>
        <div contentEdiable="true" class="textArea" id="deaconSSScriptures1"></div>
        <p>On the next page, write your plans to have meaningful
        prayer and scripture study during your years as a priest.
        Your scripture study could include the words of the living
        prophets in the conference issues of the Ensign or Liahona.</p>
        
        <h4>Act</h4>
        <p>My plan for strengthening my habit of regular prayer and
        scripture study:</p>
        <div contentEdiable="true" class="textArea" id="deaconSSScriptures"></div>
        
        <h4>Share</h4>
        <p>Share what you are learning from your scripture study. For
        example, you could share with your
        family, with friends, in seminary, or
        in quorum meetings. Make sharing
        what you learn a regular practice.
        This will strengthen your testimony
        and help you learn how to teach the
        gospel. It will also strengthen the
        testimony of others.</p>

            <p>Review the <a href="/LDSYouth/dutyToGod/teacher/teacherPDInvite.html">plan</a> you made to become a good home teacher. Looking back on your home teaching efforts, what do you feel you have done well? On the next page, write some ways you want to improve.</p>
            <p>Write your answers to the following questions, and discuss them with your parents or quorum members:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>How does your example affect your ability to teach the gospel to others?</li>
                <li>What can you do as a priest to teach the gospel through your actions as well as your words?</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Continue in your efforts to share the gospel. Think about family members and friends whom you could invite to come unto Christ. Write down their names and what you will do to help them. Include names of Aaronic Priesthood holders who arenâ€™t actively participating in the Church.</p>

            <h2>Act</h2>
            <p>My plan to improve as a home teacher:</p>
            <div contentEditable="true" class="textArea" id="priestPDInvite1"></div>
            <p>Names of people and how I will help them come unto Christ:</p>
            <div contentEditable="true" class="textArea" id="priestPDInvite2"></div>

            <h2>Share</h2>
            <p>Share with your parents or a priesthood leader the experiences you have as you help others come unto Christ. Discuss how this is helping you prepare for a full-time mission and become a lifelong missionary.</p>

        <h2>Live Worthily</h2>
        
        <h4>Learn</h4>
        <p>▪ Read Doctrine and Covenants
        121:34–40, and identify the effect that
        sin has on priesthood power. Contrast
        the examples of Joseph and David as
        found in Genesis 39, 41 and 2 Samuel
        11–12. Ponder how their actions
        affected their spiritual strength, and
        share your thoughts with a parent or quorum leader. Discuss
        what David could have done to avoid the tragedy that occurred
        in his life.</p>
        <p>Prepare a lesson or a talk on how repentance and the Atonement
        can help us remain worthy as priesthood holders. Consider
        using Preach My Gospel, pages 51–52; True to the Faith,
        pages 14–21; or “The Living Christ” (see page 106 of this
        book). With your parents or a priesthood leader, determine
        when and where you can give your talk or lesson, and write
        your plan on the next page.</p>
        <p>Choose at least four sections from For the Strength of Youth to
        study and apply; choose sections that will help you live worthy
        to enter the temple and participate in sacred ordinances.</p>
        
        <h4>Act</h4>
        <p>My plan to give a talk or lesson about repentance and the
        Atonement:</p>
        <div contentEditable="true" class="textArea" id="priestSSWorthily1"></div>
        <p>Sections from For the Strength of Youth I will study</p>
        <div contentEditable="true" class="textArea" id="priestSSWorthily2"></div>
        <p>Specific things I will do to live these standards and help others
        do the same:</p>
        <div contentEditable="true" class="textArea" id="priestSSWorthily3"></div>
        
        <h4>Share</h4>
        <p>Share with others how living the
        standards in For the Strength of Youth
        has affected you and infl uenced those
        around you. You could share this with
        your family, at church, or in seminary.</p>

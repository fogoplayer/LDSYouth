        <h2>Invite All to Come Unto Christ</h2>
        
        <h4>Learn</h4>
        <p>Read Doctrine and Covenants 20:59.
        What does the phrase “come unto
        Christ” mean to you? Share your
        thoughts and feelings with a quorum
        leader or your parents, and ask what
        the phrase means to them.</p>
        <p>Contrast the missionary stories of Ammon (Alma 17–19) and
        Corianton (Alma 39:1–11). What infl uence did their actions
        have on the people they taught? Consider ways you can set
        a good example that can help people come unto Christ.</p>
        <p>Think about family members and friends whom you could
        invite to come unto Christ. Write down their names and
        what you will do to help them (such as inviting them to
        a Church activity or giving them a copy of the Book of
        Mormon or a Church magazine).</p>

        <h2>Share</h2>
        <p>Write down in a journal or a notebook
        the experiences you have as you invite
        others to come unto Christ. Also
        write down ways you feel you are becoming
        a better missionary. Consider
        sharing your experiences with others.</p>

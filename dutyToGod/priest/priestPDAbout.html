        <h2>About</h2>
        
        <p>The Lord has said that every priesthood holder should “learn
        his duty” and “act . . . in all diligence” (D&C 107:99). This section
        will help you learn and fulfi ll your duties as a priest, which
        are outlined in Doctrine and Covenants 20:46–52, 75–79 and
        which include all the duties of a deacon and a teacher (see pages
        23 and 46–47). Your duties can be organized into three groups:</p>
        
        <h4>Administer Priesthood Ordinances</h4>
        <p>Priests offi ciate at the sacrament table and offer the sacramental
        prayers. They can prepare and pass the sacrament.
        They can also baptize, confer the Aaronic Priesthood, and
        ordain deacons, teachers, and other priests.</p>
        
        <h4>Serve Others</h4>
        <p>Priests assist the bishop in “administering . . . temporal
        things” (D&C 107:68). This may include gathering fast offerings,
        caring for the poor and needy, caring for the meetinghouse
        and grounds, serving as a messenger for the bishop,
        and fulfi lling other assignments from the bishop</p>
        
        <h4>Invite All to Come unto Christ</h4>
        <p>Priests “preach, teach, expound, exhort, . . . and visit the house
        of each member, and exhort them to pray vocally and in secret
        and attend to all family duties” (D&C 20:46–47). One way to
        do this is by serving as a home teacher. Priests also continue
        to “see that there is no iniquity in the church, neither hardness
        with each other, neither lying, backbiting, nor evil speaking”
        (D&C 20:54). This responsibility includes being a peacemaker 
        and being an example of moral integrity and uprightness.</p>
        <p>They continue to “warn, expound, exhort, and teach, and
        invite all to come unto Christ” (D&C 20:59). This includes
        setting a good example, fellowshipping quorum members
        and others, speaking in Church meetings, sharing the gospel,
        and bearing testimony.</p>

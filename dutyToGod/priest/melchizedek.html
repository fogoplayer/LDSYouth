        <h2>Preparing to Recieve the Melchizedek Priesthood</h2>
        
        <p>During your years as a priest, use the steps on the following
        pages to create a project that will help you prepare to receive
        the Melchizedek Priesthood and serve a full-time mission. This
        project builds on what you have accomplished throughout
        your years as an Aaronic Priesthood holder. It should be challenging
        and should include a signifi cant time commitment. It
        should also be based on your own needs and circumstances.</p>
        
        <h4>Step One: Learn</h4>
        <p>When you receive the Melchizedek Priesthood, you enter into
        the oath and covenant of the priesthood. To learn about this
        oath and covenant, read Doctrine and Covenants 84:33–44
        and “Melchizedek Priesthood” in True to the Faith (pages
        101–2). Then, with help from your bishop or your parents,
        plan a time when you can teach others what you have learned
        (for example, in priests quorum meeting, sacrament meeting,
        or family home evening).</p>
        
        <p>One important duty of the Melchizedek Priesthood is to preach
the gospel (see D&C 53:3). To prepare for this duty, fi nd out
what will be required of you when you serve a full-time mission.
Consider the following:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Personal worthiness and testimony.</li>
          <li>Gospel knowledge.</li>
          <li>Christlike attributes.</li>
          <li>Work habits and physical health.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>To learn about the requirements for missionary service, use
        the following sources: your parents, your bishop, returned
        missionaries, the Missionary Handbook, Preach My Gospel, and
        talks by General Authorities (some of these talks can be found
        at DutytoGod.lds.org). Write down what you learn.</p>
        
        <h4>Step 2: Create a Project</h4>
        <p>Create a project that will help you apply what you’ve learned.
        It should include two parts: (1) preparation to receive the
        Melchizedek Priesthood and (2) preparation for a full-time
        mission. Have a parent or leader approve your project before
        you begin working on it. Here are some examples of things
        you could include in each part of your project:</p>
        
        <h5>Examples-Melchizedek Priesthood</h5>
        <ol>
          <li>Read the entire Book of Mormon. In
          a journal, write what you learn from
          your study and write specifi c examples
          from your life that show how
          consistent scripture study gives you
          power to resist temptation.</li>
          <li>Interview three Melchizedek Priesthood
          holders (such as your father or
          the elders quorum president in your
          ward). Ask them questions such as the following, and write
          their answers:
          <ol>
            <li>What are the duties of an elder?</li>
            <li>What is the difference between having the authority of the
            priesthood and holding priesthood keys?</li>
            <li>What would you recommend I do to understand and
            prepare to receive the Melchizedek Priesthood?</li>
            <li>What experiences have you had in which you were able
            to serve others by exercising the Melchizedek Priesthood?</li>
            <li>How has holding the Melchizedek Priesthood blessed
            your life?</li>
            <li>How do you perform the ordinances of the Melchizedek
            Priesthood (such as consecrating oil, administering to the
            sick, and bestowing the gift of the Holy Ghost)?</li>
          </ol>
          </li>
        </ol>
        
        <h5>Examples-Full-Time Mission</h5>
        <ol>
          <li>Find examples of missionaries in the scriptures (such as the
          Savior, Enoch, Ammon, and Samuel the Lamanite). Identify
          what made them effective, the promises they received, and
          the effect their work had on the people they served. Make a
          list of what you fi nd. Share your list with a returned missionary.
          Ask him or her to share experiences from his or her
          mission that illustrate these principles and attributes.</li>
          <li>Practice teaching some of the lessons in chapter 3 of Preach
          My Gospel. Schedule regular opportunities to go teaching
          with the full-time missionaries in your area, and be prepared
          to help the missionaries teach.</li>
          <li>Interview three returned missionaries. Ask them questions
          such as the following, and write their answers:
          <ol>
            <li>What would you recommend I do to prepare for a fulltime
            mission?</li>
            <li>What qualities make a missionary effective, and what can
            I do to develop those qualities?</li>
            <li>How is your life different now because you served a
            mission?</li>
          </ol>
          </li>
          <li>Refer to what you wrote about the requirements for missionary
          service (see page 85), and make a plan to improve in each area
          (personal worthiness and testimony, gospel knowledge, Christlike
          attributes, and work habits and physical health).</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>For The Strength Of Youth: Physical Health</h2>
        
        <p>After you have begun working on your plans in “Spiritual
        Strength” and “Priesthood Duties,” create a project based
        on the standards in the “Physical Health” section of For the
        Strength of Youth. Use the steps on the following pages as a
        guide. Your project should be challenging and should include a
        signifi cant time commitment. It should be based on your own
        needs and interests. It should establish a pattern that will help
        you build and maintain physical health
        throughout your life.</p>
        
        <h4>Step One: Learn</h4>
        <p>Read “Physical Health” in For the
        Strength of Youth, and study the following
        scriptures: Doctrine and Covenants
        88:124, Doctrine and Covenants 89, and
        1 Corinthians 3:16–17. Identify principles
        that relate to physical health. Write down
        your answers to the following questions,
        and share them with a parent, a priesthood
        leader, or quorum members:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Why is it important to be physically
          healthy? How will being physically
          healthy help you fulfi ll your
          priesthood duties (including as a
          missionary, as a father, and in your
          service to others)?</li>
          <li>What are the spiritual benefi ts of
          being physically healthy? What
          are the spiritual consequences of
          not caring for our physical bodies
          properly?</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h4>Step 2: Create a Project</h4>
        <p>Create a project that will help you apply what you have
        learned about physical health. It should include two parts:
        (1) regular exercise and (2) nutrition. Have a parent or leader
        approve your project before you begin working on it. Here
        are some examples of things you could include in each part of
        your project:</p>
        
        <h4></h4>
        <div contentEditable="true" class="textArea" id="deaconPDInvite1"></div>
        <p>Names of people and how I will help them come unto Christ:</p>
        <div contentEditable="true" class="textArea" id="deaconPDInvite2"></div>
        
        <h2>Share</h2>
        <p>Write down in a journal or a notebook
        the experiences you have as you invite
        others to come unto Christ. Also
        write down ways you feel you are becoming
        a better missionary. Consider
        sharing your experiences with others.</p>

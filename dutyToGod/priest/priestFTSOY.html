            <h2>For The Strength Of Youth: Family and Friends</h2>

            <p>After you have begun working on your plans in “<a href="/LDSYouth/dutyToGod/priest/priestSS.html">Spiritual Strength</a>” and “<a href="LDSYouth/dutyToGod/priest/priestPD.html">Priesthood Duties</a>,” create a project based on the standards in the “<a href="https://www.lds.org/youth/for-the-strength-of-youth/family">Family</a>” and “<a href="https://www.lds.org/youth/for-the-strength-of-youth/friends">Friends</a>” sections of For the Strength of Youth. Use the steps on the following pages as a guide. Your project should be challenging and should include a significant time commitment. It should also be based on your own needs and interests. It should be focused on choosing friends wisely and learning how to treat others, especially your family members, in a Christlike way.</p>

            <h4>Step One: Learn</h4>
            <p>Study <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/5">Matthew 5–7</a> or <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/12">3 Nephi 12–14</a> and make a list of what the Savior taught about how to treat others. Then find examples in the scriptures where Christ or others exemplified some of these principles. Read “<a href="https://www.lds.org/youth/for-the-strength-of-youth/family">Family</a>” and “<a href="https://www.lds.org/youth/for-the-strength-of-youth/friends">Friends</a>” in For the Strength of Youth, and find phrases that express these principles.</p>
            <div contenteditable="true" class="textArea" id="priestFTSOY1"></div>
            <p>Write your answers to the following questions, and share them with your parents or quorum members:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>How is your priesthood service different when you love those you serve?
                </li>
                <li>What experiences have you had in which someone showed Christlike love for you?</li>
                <li>How can you show your love for family members and others?</li>
            </ol>
            
            <div contenteditable="true" class="textArea" id="priestFTSOY2"></div>

            <h4>Step 2: Create a Project</h4>
            <p>Create a project that will help you apply what you have learned about loving others. It should include two parts: (1) plans to improve your relationship with your family and (2) plans to be a better friend. Have a parent or leader approve your project before you begin working on it. Here are some examples of things you could include in each part of your project:</p>

            <h5>Examples-Family</h5>
            <ol>
                <li>Make a list of ways you can help build a happy home. Base your list on the standards in the “<a href="https://www.lds.org/youth/for-the-strength-of-youth/family">Family</a>” section of For the Strength of Youth (for example, be cheerful, helpful, and considerate; be a peacemaker; and honor your parents). Do those things, and record the difference it makes in your home.</li>
                <li>Plan an activity with a family member with whom you would like to improve your relationship. For example, you could take an interest in his or her hobbies, find a place to talk, or play games together.</li>
            </ol>

            <h5>Examples-Friends</h5>
            <ol>
                <li>Make a list of things you can do to be a better friend. For examples, see the “<a href="https://www.lds.org/youth/for-the-strength-of-youth/friends">Friends</a>” section of For the Strength of Youth. Do those things, and record the difference it makes in your relationships. If appropriate, include names of specific people in your list.</li>
                <li>Interview a mother, grandmother, sister, or other woman to learn about how to show proper respect to women. Make a plan to apply what you learn. Note how carrying out your plan improves your relationship with women. Here are some questions you might ask:
                    <ol>
                        <li>How can a son show proper respect for his mother?</li>
                        <li>How can an Aaronic Priesthood holder show proper respect for young women?</li>
                        <li>How can a young man show proper respect for his future wife before and after they are married?</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Invite a new convert, a friend of another faith, or a less-active member to attend a Church activity with you. Help him or her feel welcome and included.</li>
            </ol>

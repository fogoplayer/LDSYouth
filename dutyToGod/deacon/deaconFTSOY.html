        <h2>For The Strength Of Youth: Physical Health</h2>
        
        <p>After you have begun working on your plans in “<a href="/LDSYouth/dutyToGod/deacon/deaconSS.html">Spiritual
        Strength</a>” and “<a href="/LDSYouth/dutyToGod/deacon/deaconPD.html">Priesthood Duties</a>,” create a project based
        on the standards in the “<a href="https://www.lds.org/youth/for-the-strength-of-youth/physical-and-emotional-health">Physical Health</a>” section of For the
        Strength of Youth. Use the steps on the following pages as a
        guide. Your project should be challenging and should include a
        signifi cant time commitment. It should be based on your own
        needs and interests. It should establish a pattern that will help
        you build and maintain physical health
        throughout your life.</p>
        
        <h4>Step One: Learn</h4>
        <p>Read “<a href="https://www.lds.org/youth/for-the-strength-of-youth/physical-and-emotional-health">Physical Health</a>” in For the
        Strength of Youth, and study the following
        scriptures: <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.124">Doctrine and Covenants
        88:124</a>, <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.124">Doctrine and Covenants 89</a>, and
        <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/1-cor/3.16-17">1 Corinthians 3:16–17</a>. Identify principles
        that relate to physical health. Write down
        your answers to the following questions,
        and share them with a parent, a priesthood
        leader, or quorum members:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Why is it important to be physically
          healthy? How will being physically
          healthy help you fulfill your
          priesthood duties (including as a
          missionary, as a father, and in your
          service to others)?</li>
          <li>What are the spiritual benefits of
          being physically healthy? What
          are the spiritual consequences of
          not caring for our physical bodies
          properly?</li>
        </ol>
        
        <div contentEditable="true" class="textArea" id="deaconFTSOY1"></div>
        
        <h4>Step 2: Create a Project</h4>
        <p>Create a project that will help you apply what you have
        learned about physical health. It should include two parts:
        (1) regular exercise and (2) nutrition. Have a parent or leader
        approve your project before you begin working on it. Here
        are some examples of things you could include in each part of
        your project:</p>
        
        <h5>Examples-Regular Exercise</h5>
        <ol>
          <li>Create a monthly exercise chart. Include a variety of exercises
          that help you become more physically fit, such as
          running, biking, or training for a sport.</li>
          <li>Learn and participate in a sport.</li>
          <li>Increase your capabilities in a physical activity you are
          already involved in.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h5>Examples-Nutrition</h5>
        <ol>
          <li>Make a commitment to live the Word of Wisdom. Include in
          your commitment: (a) how you will avoid situations in which
          you may be tempted to violate this commitment and (b) how
          you will respond to temptations (for example, ways you
          might explain to others why you obey the Word of Wisdom).</li>
          <li>Learn principles of proper nutrition from <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/89">Doctrine and
          Covenants 89</a> and from books, the Internet, or other sources.
          Teach your family or quorum what you discover. Keep a
          record of what you eat for a month, and then make changes
          to your diet based on what you have learned about nutrition.</li>
          <li>Learn how to prepare three nutritionally balanced meals.
          Prepare them for your family.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h5>My Project</h5>
        <p>Regular Exercise</p>
        <div contentEditable="true" class="textArea" id="deaconFTSOY2"></div>
        <p>Nutrition</p>
        <div contentEditable="true" class="textArea" id="deaconFTSOY3"></div>
        
        <p>Approval of a Parent or Leader</p>
        <div contentEditable="true" class="textArea signoff" id="deaconFTSOYSignoff1"></div>
        <p>Estimated Date of Completion</p>
        <div contentEditable="true" class="textArea signoff" id="deaconFTSOYSignoff2"></div>
        <p>My Signature</p>
        <div contentEditable="true" class="textArea signoff" id="deaconFTSOYSignoff3"></div>
        <p>Date Completed</p>
        <div contentEditable="true" class="textArea signoff" id="deaconFTSOYSignoff4"></div>
        
        <h4>Step 3: Report Your Experiences</h4>
        <p>In the space below, write what you have learned from carrying
        out your project and how it has prepared you for your future
        responsibilities. Report on your experiences to your family or
        quorum members.</p>

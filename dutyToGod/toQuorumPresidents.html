        <h2>To Quorum Presidents</h2>
        
        <p>The Lord has entrusted you with the priesthood keys for your
        quorum (see D&C 124:142–43). Part of your responsibility,
        as you direct the work of your quorum, is to “teach [quorum
        members] their duty” (see D&C 107:85–87). </p>
        <p>This book can be an effective tool to help you teach quorum
        members their priesthood duties and encourage them to
        strengthen their testimony and their relationship with Heavenly
        Father. Consider the following as you help them make
        and carry out their plans:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Soon after a young man joins your quorum, visit him in his
          home and make sure he has a copy of this book. Use the
          book to give him an overview of his priesthood duties. Show
          him some of your plans and tell him about the experiences
          you are having.</li>
          <li>Set a good example by making and carrying out your own
          plans. Share your experiences with quorum members.</li>
          <li>Invite quorum members to share their experiences in
          quorum meetings, and encourage them to share with their
          families. For example, during the fi rst few minutes of quorum
          meeting you could invite them to share what they are
          learning as they follow their plans to study the scriptures or
          serve others.</li>
          <li>As you plan quorum meetings and activities, look for ways
          to include the plans your quorum members have made.
          For example, you could invite a quorum member to teach a
          lesson in quorum meeting about one
          of the doctrines he is studying (see
          pages 19, 43, and 67).</li>
          <li>As you exercise your priesthood keys to
          help quorum members learn and fulfi ll
          their duties, your relationship with
          them will be strengthened. When quorum
          members work closely together,
          they help each other stay strong in the
          gospel and united as a quorum. </li>

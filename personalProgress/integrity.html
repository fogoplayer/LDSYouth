        <h4 class="purple-text">Required Value Experiences</h4>
        <p>Complete the following three required value experiences. Have your
        parent or leader sign and date each experience after you finish.</p>
        
        <ol>
          <li>Integrity is the willingness and desire to live by our beliefs and
          standards. Read Moroni 10:30–33 and think about what it means to “deny
          yourselves of all ungodliness.” Read the pamphlet For the Strength of
          Youth. Reflect on how the Lord’s standards differ from the world’s
          standards. Record in your journal appropriate standards for behavior,
          dress, and conversation, as well as literature, movies, television,
          Internet, music, cell phones, and other media. Also write your plan to
          stay morally clean and worthy to attend the temple. After keeping your
          standards for at least one month, record your feelings in your journal
          and continue to keep your commitment.
          <div contentEditable="true" class="textArea signoff purple lighten-4" id="integritySignoff1"/></li>
          
          <li>Conduct a self-assessment of your personal integrity. Ask yourself
          the following questions: Do I avoid gossip, inappropriate jokes,
          swearing and profanity, and being light-minded about sacred subjects?
          Am I completely truthful, morally clean, honest, dependable, and
          trustworthy in my schoolwork and other activities? Pray daily for
          strength and for the guidance of the Holy Ghost to help you live with
          integrity. Write in your journal the things you can do to improve your
          personal integrity and at least one new habit you want to develop.
          <div contentEditable="true" class="textArea signoff purple lighten-4" id="integritySignoff2"/></li>
          
          <li>The Savior is the perfect example of integrity; He did what He
          promised the Father He would do. Read 3 Nephi 11:10–11. Study the
          lives of other individuals in the scriptures who lived with integrity.
          Read Genesis 39; the book of Esther; Job 2:3; 27:3–6; Daniel 3 and 6;
          Acts 26; Doctrine and Covenants 124:15; and Joseph Smith—History
          1:21–25. In your journal identify the ways these people demonstrated
          integrity. Think of a time when you had the courage to show integrity,
          especially when it was not easy or popular. Share your experience and
          your feelings about it in a testimony meeting or lesson or with a
          parent or leader.
          <div contentEditable="true" class="textArea signoff purple lighten-4" id="integritySignoff3"/></li>
        </ol>
        
        <h4 class="purple-text">Additional Value Experiences</h4>
        <p>Complete three additional value experiences. You may select from the
        following options or write up to two of your own. Your parent or leader
        must approve those you write yourself before you begin. Have your parent
        or leader sign and date each experience after you finish.</p>
        
        <ol start="4">
          <li>RLook up the word integrity in a dictionary. Interview your
          mother, grandmother, or another woman you respect about her
          understanding and application of the word. Make a list of ways you can 
          ake your actions consistent with your knowledge of right and wrong,
          and record in your journal what it means to you to have integrity.
          <div contentEditable="true" class="textArea signoff purple lighten-4" id="integritySignoff4"/></li>
          
          <li>Learn about standing as a witness. Read Mosiah 18:9. Then recor
          in your journal how you can personally “stand as [a witness] of God at
          all times and in all things, and in all places.” Choose a personal
          behavior that you need to improve so you can be a better example.
          Develop integrity in your life as you practice your new behavior for
          three weeks. Record your progress in your journal.
          <div contentEditable="true" class="textArea signoff purple lighten-4" id="integritySignoff5"/></li>
          
          <li>Living the law of the fast is an opportunity to practice
          integrity. On a designated fast Sunday, abstain from food and drink
          for two consecutive meals and contribute to your family’s fast
          offering. Have a specific purpose in mind as you fast. You might fast
          for a sick friend, to overcome a bad habit, to obtain a special
          blessing for yourself or someone else, or to give thanks. Begin and
          close your fast with a prayer.
          <div contentEditable="true" class="textArea signoff purple lighten-4" id="integritySignoff6"/></li>
          
          <li>List the issues, trends, and problems that weaken the family. Read
          the First Presidency message, “The Family: A Proclamation to the
          World”, and the section on family in For the Strength of Youth. Then
          research in the Church magazines the counsel of those whom we sustain
          as prophets, seers, and revelators. Write in your journal your plan to
          strengthen your present family and the values and traditions you want
          to establish with your future family.
          <div contentEditable="true" class="textArea signoff purple lighten-4" id="integritySignoff7"/></li>
        </ol>
        
        <h4 class="purple-text">Personalized Value Experiences</h4>
        
        <ol start="8">
          <li><div contentEditable="true" class="textArea" id="integrityGoal8"></div><div contentEditable="true" class="textArea signoff purple lighten-4" id="integritySignoff8"/></li>
          <li><div contentEditable="true" class="textArea" id="integrityGoal9"></div><div contentEditable="true" class="textArea signoff purple lighten-4" id="integritySignoff9"/></li>
        </ol>
        
        <h4 class="purple-text">Value Project</h4>
        
        <p>After you have completed six integrity value experiences, create a
        project that will help you practice what you have learned. This should
        be a significant effort that will take at least ten hours to complete.
        Prayerfully seek the guidance of the Holy Ghost to select a meaningful
        project.</p>

            <p>Remember the worth of souls is great in the sight of God
            (D&C 18:10).</p>
            <p>I am of infinite worth with my own divine mission, which I will
            strive to fulfill.</p>

        <h4>Required Value Experiences</h4>
        <p>Complete the following three required value experiences. Have your
        parent or leader sign and date each experience after you finish.</p>
        
        <ol>
          <li>You are a daughter of Heavenly Father, who knows you and loves you.
          Read Psalm 8:4–6; Jeremiah 1:5; John 13:34; Doctrine and Covenants 18:10; Abraham 3:22–23; and Joseph Smith—History 1:1–20. Write in your journal how these scriptures teach you that Heavenly Father knows you, loves you, and is mindful of you.</li>
          
          <li>Learn about the importance of patriarchal blessings by studying about them in True to the Faith and recent conference talks. Find out why they are given and who can give them. Discuss with a parent or Church leader how to prepare to receive a patriarchal blessing and how it can teach you of your worth and identity and be a guide throughout your life. If you have not received your blessing, prepare to receive it.</li>
          
          <li>Read Doctrine and Covenants 18:10 and 121:45. Do all you can to build others and make them feel of worth. Every day for two weeks notice the worthwhile qualities and attributes of others. Acknowledge them verbally or in writing. In your journal write what you have learned about the worth of individuals and how your own confidence grows when you build others.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h4>Additional Value Experiences</h4>
        <p>Complete three additional value experiences. You may select from the
        following options or write up to two of your own. Your parent or leader
        must approve those you write yourself before you begin. Have your parent
        or leader sign and date each experience after you finish.</p>
        
        <ol start="4">
          <li>You are preparing now to fulfill a unique mission on the earth. Read Doctrine and Covenants 88:119. In your journal make a list of your hopes and dreams for your future home, family, and education and some important things you would like to accomplish in your life, including becoming a wife and mother. Then write a plan that will help you achieve your goals. Share this plan with a family member, leader, or friend.</li>
          
          <li>Participate in a dance, speech, music, or drama performance at school, in your community, or at church. How did your participation in this activity strengthen your feelings of individual worth and self-confidence? Record your thoughts in your journal.</li>
          
          <li>When you participate in family history, you come to understand your identity and individual worth. Visit with your living relatives to learn as much information about your family history as possible. Then complete a pedigree chart of your family and list the temple ordinances that have been completed for each person.</li>
          
          <li>Heavenly Father has given you special gifts. Read 1 Corinthians 12:4–12; 13; Moroni 7:12–13; 10:8–18; and Doctrine and Covenants 46:11–26. Ask a family member, a Young Women leader, and a friend to write down positive qualities the Lord has given you. List your gifts in your journal, and write how you can continue to develop these gifts and use them to serve your family and others.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h4>Personalized Value Experiences</h4>
        
        <ol start="8">
          <li><div contentEditable="true" class="textArea" id="individualWorth8"></div></li>
          <li><div contentEditable="true" class="textArea" id="individualWorth9"></div></li>
        </ol>
        
        <h4>Value Project</h4>
        
        <p>After you have completed six faith value experiences, create a
        project that will help you practice what you have learned. This should
        be a significant effort that will take at least ten hours to complete.
        Prayerfully seek the guidance of the Holy Ghost to select a meaningful
        project.</p>

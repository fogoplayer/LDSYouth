        <h2>Welcome To Personal Progress</h2>
        
        <p>You are a beloved daughter of Heavenly Father, prepared to come to
        the earth at this particular time for a sacred and glorious purpose.
        You have a noble responsibility to use your strength and influence for
        good. Your loving Heavenly Father has blessed you with talents and
        abilities that will help you fulfill your divine mission. As you learn
        to accept and act upon the Young Women values in your life, you will
        form personal habits of prayer, scripture study, obedience to the
        commandments, and service to others. These daily personal habits will
        strengthen your faith in and testimony of Jesus Christ. They will also
        allow you to recognize and develop your unique gifts.</p>
        
        <p>Always use your influence to lift and bless your family, other young
        women, and the young men with whom you associate. Honor womanhood,
        support the priesthood, and cherish faithful motherhood and fatherhood.</p>
        
        <p>As you participate in Personal Progress, you join with thousands of
        other young women who are striving to come unto Christ and “stand as
        witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places”
        (Mosiah 18:9). Counsel with your parents, and prayerfully choose goals
        that will help you cultivate feminine attributes, strengthen your
        testimony, and reach your divine potential. Take advantage of your time
        in Young Women by preparing to receive the sacred ordinances of the
        temple, to become a faithful wife and mother, and to strengthen your
        home and family.</p>

        <h4 class="green-text">Required Value Experiences</h4>
        <p>Complete the following three required value experiences. Have your
        parent or leader sign and date each experience after you finish.</p>
        
        <ol>
          <li>Learn about the importance of gaining knowledge by reading
          Proverbs 1:5; 4:7; 2 Nephi 28:30; and Doctrine and Covenants 88:78–80,
          118; 90:15; 130:18–19; 131:6. Think about why you need to gain
          knowledge and understanding about how to apply gospel principles to
          your present and future home and family life. Write in your journal
          what you have learned about knowledge, and discuss it with a family
          member or Young Women leader.
          <div contentEditable="true" class="textArea signoff green lighten-4" id="knowledgeSignoff1"></div></li>
          
          <li>In your journal list talents you have and others you would like to
          develop. Read Matthew 25:14–30. Learn a new skill or talent that will
          help you care for your own future family or home (for example, playing
          the piano, singing, budgeting, time management, cooking, sewing, or
          child care). Share with your family, class, or Young Women leader what
          you have learned.
          <div contentEditable="true" class="textArea signoff green lighten-4" id="knowledgeSignoff2"></div></li>
          
          <li>Memorize Article of Faith number thirteen and recite it to a
          parent, a leader, or another adult. Then visit a museum or exhibit or
          attend a performance that involves dance, music, speech, or drama.
          Using this article of faith as a guide, evaluate what you saw and
          heard. In your journal write your thoughts about how you can use this
          article of faith as a guide for all you do so the Holy Ghost will be
          your constant companion. Share those thoughts with a parent or leader.
          <div contentEditable="true" class="textArea signoff green lighten-4" id="knowledgeSignoff3"></div></li>
        </ol>
        
        <h4 class="green-text">Additional Value Experiences</h4>
        <p>Complete three additional value experiences. You may select from the
        following options or write up to two of your own. Your parent or leader
        must approve those you write yourself before you begin. Have your parent
        or leader sign and date each experience after you finish.</p>
        
        <ol start="4">
          <li>Select a gospel principle you would like to understand better (for
          example, faith, repentance, charity, eternal families, or baptismal
          covenants). Read scriptures and the words of latter-day prophets that
          relate to the principle. Prepare a five-minute talk on the subject and
          give the talk in a sacrament meeting, in a Young Women meeting, to
          your family, or to your class. Record in your journal how you can
          apply this gospel principle in your life.
          <div contentEditable="true" class="textArea signoff green lighten-4" id="knowledgeSignoff4"></div></li>
          
          <li>Learn about an area of work or service that interests you. Talk to
          someone who works in that field and find out what that person’s job
          responsibilities are, what training or education the person obtained
          to do the job, and what contributions this person’s job makes to
          society. Record your findings in your journal.
          <div contentEditable="true" class="textArea signoff green lighten-4" id="knowledgeSignoff5"></div></li>
          
          <li>Memorize two of your favorite hymns from the hymnbook. Learn the
          correct conducting pattern for the hymns (see Hymns, 383–85) and then
          conduct them at least two times at a family home evening, in a Young
          Women or other Church meeting, or at seminary. Read the scriptures
          listed at the bottom of each hymn.
          <div contentEditable="true" class="textArea signoff green lighten-4" id="knowledgeSignoff6"></div></li>
          
          <li>At Young Women camp you learn skills in first aid, safety,
          sanitation, and survival. Review these teachings in your Young Women
          Camp Manual and note in your journal how you could apply them in your
          home to keep your family safe. Develop a list of basic supplies your
          family will need in case of an emergency. Teach a family home evening
          lesson or share with a Young Women leader what you have learned and
          what additional skills you would like to learn to be prepared for
          emergencies.
          <div contentEditable="true" class="textArea signoff green lighten-4" id="knowledgeSignoff7"></div></li>
        </ol>
        
        <h4 class="green-text">Personalized Value Experiences</h4>
        
        <ol start="8">
          <li><div contentEditable="true" class="textArea" id="Knowledge8"></div><div contentEditable="true" class="textArea signoff green lighten-4" id="knowledgeSignoff8"></div></li>
          <li><div contentEditable="true" class="textArea" id="Knowledge9"></div><div contentEditable="true" class="textArea signoff green lighten-4" id="knowledgeSignoff9"></div></li>
        </ol>
        
        <h4 class="green-text">Value Project</h4>
        
        <p>After you have completed six knowledge value experiences, create a
        project that will help you practice what you have learned. This should
        be a significant effort that will take at least ten hours to complete.
        Prayerfully seek the guidance of the Holy Ghost to select a meaningful
        project.</p>

        <h4 class="orange-text" class="orange-text">Required Value Experiences</h4>
        <p>Complete the following three required value experiences. Have your
        parent or leader sign and date each experience after you finish.</p>
        
        <ol>
          <li>A daughter of God can make wise decisions and solve problems. Read
          1 Nephi 15:8; 2 Nephi 32:3; Alma 34:19–27; Ether 2–3; and Doctrine and
          Covenants 9:7–9. Follow a pattern of regular scripture study and
          prayer to receive help in making personal decisions such as choosing
          good friends, being kind to others, getting up on time, or other
          decisions. Discuss with a parent or leader how regular scripture study
          and prayer helped you make correct decisions.
          <div contentEditable="true" class="textArea signoff orange lighten-4" id="choiceAndAccountabilitySignoff1"/></li>
          
          <li>Read the pamphlet For the Strength of Youth. List in your journal
          each standard of righteous behavior the pamphlet outlines, and record
          why it is important to choose to live those standards. Practice living
          righteous standards by choosing three standards in which you need to
          improve. You might choose to be more selective about television,
          music, books, or other media, or you might improve your modesty,
          language, or honesty. After three weeks share your progress with your
          family, your class, or a leader.
          <div contentEditable="true" class="textArea signoff orange lighten-4" id="choiceAndAccountabilitySignoff2"/></li>
          
          <li>Agency, or the ability to choose, is one of God’s greatest gifts
          to His children. Read about agency in Joshua 24:15; 2 Nephi 2; and
          Doctrine and Covenants 82:2–10. With a parent or leader, discuss the
          blessings and responsibilities of agency. Record in your journal your
          understanding of agency and the consequences of choices and actions.
          <div contentEditable="true" class="textArea signoff orange lighten-4" id="choiceAndAccountabilitySignoff3"/></li>
        </ol>
        
        <h4 class="orange-text">Additional Value Experiences</h4>
        <p>Complete three additional value experiences. You may select from the
        following options or write up to two of your own. Your parent or leader
        must approve those you write yourself before you begin. Have your parent
        or leader sign and date each experience after you finish.</p>
        
        <ol start="4">
          <li>Read about repentance in Isaiah 1:18; Alma 26:22; 34:30–35; Moroni
          8:25–26; and Doctrine and Covenants 19:15–20; 58:42–43. Record in your
          journal what repentance means to you. Study the process of repentance,
          pray for guidance, and apply the principles of repentance in your life.
          <div contentEditable="true" class="textArea signoff orange lighten-4" id="choiceAndAccountabilitySignoff4"/></li>
          
          <li>The Holy Ghost will help you make correct choices. With a parent,
          leader, or friend, learn more about the Holy Ghost by reading and
          discussing Ezekiel 36:26–27; John 14:26; 16:13; Galatians 5:22–25;
          2 Nephi 32:5; Moroni 10:4–5; and Doctrine and Covenants 11:12–14. Then
          record in your journal how the Holy Ghost can help you make good
          decisions in your daily life. Pray for and live worthy of the constant
          companionship of the Holy Ghost.
          <div contentEditable="true" class="textArea signoff orange lighten-4" id="choiceAndAccountabilitySignoff5"/></li>
          
          <li>Study the Young Women theme and what it teaches you about who you
          are, what you are to do, and why you are to do it. List in your
          journal what you will do each day with regard to modesty, dating, and
          the media to be morally clean and worthy to enter the temple. Record
          in your journal how these choices will help you remain free and happy.
          <div contentEditable="true" class="textArea signoff orange lighten-4" id="choiceAndAccountabilitySignoff6"/></li>
          
          <li>Making choices is part of Heavenly Father’s plan for us. Read
          Moses 4:1–4; 7:32; and 2 Nephi 9:51. Establish a pattern of wise money
          management by making a budget for saving and spending your money,
          including the payment of tithing. Live within your budget for at least
          three months. Set priorities that allow you to meet your most
          important needs before satisfying your wants. Record in your journal
          what you have learned and how following these patterns will continue
          to bless your life.
          <div contentEditable="true" class="textArea signoff orange lighten-4" id="choiceAndAccountabilitySignoff7"/></li>
        </ol>
        
        <h4 class="orange-text">Personalized Value Experiences</h4>
        
        <ol start="8">
          <li><div contentEditable="true" class="textArea" id="choiceAndAccountabilityGoal8"></div><div contentEditable="true" class="textArea signoff orange lighten-4" id="choiceAndAccountablilitySignoff8"/></li>

        </ol>
        
        <h4 class="orange-text">Value Project</h4>
        
        <p>After you have completed six choice and accountability value experiences, create a
        project that will help you practice what you have learned. This should
        be a significant effort that will take at least ten hours to complete.
        Prayerfully seek the guidance of the Holy Ghost to select a meaningful
        project.</p>

            <p>Faith is not to have a perfect knowledge of things; therefore if
            ye have faith ye hope for things which are not seen, which are true
            (Alma 32:21).</p>
            <p>I am a daughter of Heavenly Father, who loves me. I have faith in

        <h4>Required Value Experiences</h4>
        <p>Complete the following three required value experiences. Have your
        parent or leader sign and date each experience after you finish.</p>
        
        <ol>
          <li>The first principle of the gospel is faith in the Lord Jesus 
          Christ. Learn about faith from the scriptures and living prophets.
          Read Hebrews 11; Alma 32:17-43; Ether 12:6-22; and Joseph
          Smith—History 1:11-20. Read two general conference talks on faith.
          Exercise your own faith by establishing a habit of prayer in your
          life. Begin by regularly saying your morning and evening prayers.
          After three weeks of following this pattern, discuss with a parent or 
          leader what you have learned about faith and how daily personal prayer
          has strengthened your faith. In your journal express your feelings
          about faith and prayer.<div contentEditable="true" class="textArea signoff" id="faithSignoff1"></div></li>
          
          <li>Discover the principles of faith taught by the mothers of
          Helaman’s stripling warriors. Read Alma 56:45-48 and 57:21. Review
          what “The Family: A Proclamation to the World” says about a mother’s
          role. With a mother, grandmother, or leader, discuss the qualities a
          woman needs in order to teach children to have faith and to base their
          decisions on gospel truths. How can these principles help you in your
          life today and help you prepare to be a faithful woman, wife, and
          mother? Record your thoughts and feelings in your journal.<div contentEditable="true" class="textArea signoff" id="faithSignoff2"></div></li>
          
          <li>Living gospel principles requires faith. Read about faith in the
          Bible Dictionary or True to the Faith. Faith in the Savior Jesus
          Christ leads to action. Choose a principle such as prayer, tithing,
          fasting, repentance, or keeping the Sabbath day holy. In your own home
          or another setting, plan and present a family home evening lesson
          about how faith helps you live that gospel principle. If possible, ask
          a family member to share an experience that has strengthened his or
          her faith. Share your own experiences as well. In your journal write
          down one of those experiences and describe your feelings about faith.<div contentEditable="true" class="textArea signoff" id="faithSignoff3"></div></li>
        </ol>
        
        <h4>Additional Value Experiences</h4>
        <p>Complete three additional value experiences. You may select from the
        following options or write up to two of your own. Your parent or leader
        must approve those you write yourself before you begin. Have your parent
        or leader sign and date each experience after you finish.</p>
        
        <ol start="4">
          <li>Learn more about the sacrament. Read about the Last Supper in
          Matthew 26:26-28; Mark 14:22-24; and Luke 22:17-20. Establish a
          pattern of pondering during the sacrament by listening carefully to
          the sacrament hymn and prayers. Think about why we partake of the
          bread and water. After three weeks of following this pattern, write in
          your journal some of the promises you make as you partake of the
          sacrament and remember your baptismal covenants and what you do to
          keep those promises. Record in your journal how your understanding of 
          these promises has strengthened your faith in the Savior.<div contentEditable="true" class="textArea signoff" id="faithSignoff4"></div></li>
          
          <li>Increase your understanding of the Atonement of Jesus Christ by
          reading Isaiah 53:3-12; John 3:16-17; Romans 5; 2 Nephi 9:6-7, 21-26;
          Alma 7:11-13; 34:8-17; and Doctrine and Covenants 19:15-20. In your
          journal write your feelings about the Savior and what He has done for
          you. Share your feelings in a testimony meeting.<div contentEditable="true" class="textArea signoff" id="faithSignoff5"></div></li>
          
          <li>Increase your understanding of the plan of salvation. Resources for
          study include 1 Corinthians 15:22; Revelation 12:7-9; 2 Nephi 9:1-28;
          11:4-7; Doctrine and Covenants 76:50-113; 93:33-34; Moses 4:1-4; and
          Abraham 3:24-27. Draw or obtain a picture that depicts the plan of
          salvation, including the premortal existence, birth, mortal life,
          death, judgment, and life after judgment. Using this picture, explain
          the plan of salvation to your class, your family, or a friend. Discuss
          how knowledge of the plan affects your actions, helps you understand
          your identity, and has strengthened your faith.<div contentEditable="true" class="textArea signoff" id="faithSignoff6"></div></li>
          
          <li>The Lord has commanded us to pay tithing. Read Doctrine and
          Covenants 119 and Malachi 3:8-12. Since obedience to the law of
          tithing is an evidence of your faith, pay a full tithe. After three
          months record in your journal how paying tithing has helped your faith
          grow. List blessings in your life, both large and small, that have
          come because of your faith in the principle of tithing.<div contentEditable="true" class="textArea signoff" id="faithSignoff7"></div></li>
        </ol>
        
        <h4>Personalized Value Experiences</h4>
        
        <ol start="8">
          <li><div contentEditable="true" class="textArea" id="faithGoal8"></div><div contentEditable="true" class="textArea signoff" id="faithSignoff8"></div></li>
          <li><div contentEditable="true" class="textArea" id="faithGoal9"></div><div contentEditable="true" class="textArea signoff" id="faithSignoff9"></div></li>
        </ol>
        
        <h4>Value Project</h4>
        
        <p>After you have completed six faith value experiences, create a
        project that will help you practice what you have learned. This should
        be a significant effort that will take at least ten hours to complete.
        Prayerfully seek the guidance of the Holy Ghost to select a meaningful
        project.</p>

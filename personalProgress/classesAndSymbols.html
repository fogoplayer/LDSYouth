            <h2>Young Women Classes and Symbols</h2>

            <h4>Beehive, <i>ages 12 and 13</i></h4>
            <p>The beehive was a symbol of harmony, cooperation, and work for the early pioneers of the Church. Beehive was also the first name by which young women were known. Beehives today learn to work together in cooperation and harmony as they strengthen their faith in Jesus Christ and prepare to stand for truth and righteousness. This is a time to “arise and shine forth” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/115.5">D&C 115:5</a>).</p>

            <h4>Mia Maid, <i>ages 14 and 15</i></h4>
            <p>The name Mia Maid refers historically to the Mutual Improvement Association, which adopted the emblem of the rose as a symbol of love, faith, and purity. Mia Maids today learn about love, faith, and purity as they strengthen their testimony and accept and act upon the Young Women values.</p>

            <h4>Laurel, <i>ages 16 and 17</i></h4>
            <p>For centuries the laurel wreath has been a crown woven from the leaves of the laurel tree. It is given to someone who finishes a significant achievement as a symbol of honor and accomplishment. Laurels today are finishing their preparation to make and keep sacred covenants and receive the ordinances of the temple.</p>

            <p>Be partakers of the divine nature. … Giving all diligence, add to
            your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge; and to knowledge
            temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness;
            and to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness
            charity (2 Peter 1:4–7).</p>
            <p>I have inherited divine qualities, which I will strive to
            develop.</p>
          </em>
        </h5>
        
        <h4>Required Value Experiences</h4>
        <p>Complete the following three required value experiences. Have your
        parent or leader sign and date each experience after you finish.</p>
        
        <ol>
          <li>What are some of the divine qualities of a daughter of God? Read
          “The Family: A Proclamation to the World”; 2 Peter 1; Alma 7:23–24;
          and Doctrine and Covenants 121:45. In your own words, list the divine
          qualities discussed in your reading. Think about how you can discover
          and develop each of these qualities. Record your ideas in your
          journal.<div contentEditable="true" class="textArea signoff" id="choiceAndAccountabilitySignoff1"></div></li>
          
          <li>As a young woman you are blessed with divine feminine qualities. 
          Increase your understanding of and appreciation for womanhood. Read
          Proverbs 31:10–31 and two talks on womanhood from a conference issue
          of the Church magazines. Review what “The Family: A Proclamation to
          the World” says about being a wife and a mother. Then ask your mother
          or another mother you admire what she thinks are important attributes
          for being a mother. List the attributes in your journal. Then choose
          one of those attributes and strive to develop it. After two weeks
          report your success to a parent or leader.<div contentEditable="true" class="textArea signoff" id="choiceAndAccountabilitySignoff2"></div></li>
          
          <li>Make your home life better. For two weeks make a special effort to
          strengthen your relationship with a family member by showing love
          through your actions. Refrain from judging, criticizing, or speaking
          unkindly, and watch for positive qualities in that family member.
          Write notes of encouragement, pray for this family member, find ways
          to be helpful, and verbally express your love. Share your experiences
          and the divine qualities you’ve discovered with that family member or
          with a parent or leader.<div contentEditable="true" class="textArea signoff" id="choiceAndAccountabilitySignoff3"></div></li>
        </ol>
        
        <h4>Additional Value Experiences</h4>
        <p>Complete three additional value experiences. You may select from the
        following options or write up to two of your own. Your parent or leader
        must approve those you write yourself before you begin. Have your parent
        or leader sign and date each experience after you finish.</p>
        
        <ol start="4">
          <li>Memorize the sacrament prayers in Doctrine and Covenants 20:77, 79.
          During the sacrament, listen carefully to the prayers and think about
          what it means to take upon yourself the name of Jesus Christ and how
          doing this should affect your actions and decisions. Practice keeping
          your baptismal covenants. Begin by doing something each day to
          recognize and further develop your divine qualities and to help you
          always remember the Lord Jesus Christ. After two weeks record your
          experience in your journal.<div contentEditable="true" class="textArea signoff" id="choiceAndAccountabilitySignoff4"></div></li>
          
          <li>Obedience is an attribute of the Savior. Strive to be more
          obedient to your parents. Read Luke 2:40–51 and John 6:38. Develop a
          pattern of obedience as you make a special effort to treat your
          parents with respect and kindness and do what your parents ask you to
          do without having to be reminded. After two weeks record in your
          journal how being more obedient motivated you to want to continue
          doing so and how it has helped you understand your divine nature and
          the divine roles of mothers and fathers.<div contentEditable="true" class="textArea signoff" id="choiceAndAccountabilitySignoff5"></div></li>
          
          <li>Develop your divine qualities. Read Matthew 5:9; John 15:12;
          Galatians 5:22–23; Colossians 3:12–17; 1 John 4:21; and Moroni
          7:44–48. Memorize your favorite verse from one of these passages.
          Identify the divine qualities mentioned in all these scriptures and
          list them in your journal. Select one quality, and for two weeks
          strive to make it a part of your daily life. Record your progress and
          experiences in your journal.<div contentEditable="true" class="textArea signoff" id="choiceAndAccountabilitySignoff6"></div></li>
          
          <li>Learn the definition of the word peacemaker. Then find and read
          five scriptures that teach about peacemakers. Become an example of a
          peacemaker in your home and at school as you refrain from criticizing,
          complaining, or speaking unkindly to or about others. Pray each
          morning and evening to Heavenly Father for help to do this. After two
          weeks write in your journal what new habits you want to develop, how
          being a peacemaker is part of your divine nature, and how you will
          continue to be a peacemaker.<div contentEditable="true" class="textArea signoff" id="choiceAndAccountabilitySignoff7"></div></li>
        </ol>
        
        <h4>Personalized Value Experiences</h4>
        
        <ol start="8">
          <li><div contentEditable="true" class="textArea" id="divineNatureGoal8"></div><div contentEditable="true" class="textArea signoff" id="choiceAndAccountabilitySignoff8"></div></li>
          <li><div contentEditable="true" class="textArea" id="divineNatureGoal9"></div><div contentEditable="true" class="textArea signoff" id="choiceAndAccountabilitySignoff9"></div></li>
        </ol>
        
        <h4>Value Project</h4>
        
        <p>After you have completed six faith value experiences, create a
        project that will help you practice what you have learned. This should
        be a significant effort that will take at least ten hours to complete.
        Prayerfully seek the guidance of the Holy Ghost to select a meaningful
        project.</p>

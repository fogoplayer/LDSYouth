        <h5>“Give me a young woman who loves home and family, who reads and
        ponders the scriptures daily, who has a burning testimony of the Book of
        Mormon. Give me a young woman who faithfully attends her church
        meetings, who is a seminary graduate, who has earned her Young Womanhood
        Recognition Award and wears it with pride! Give me a young woman who is
        virtuous and who has maintained her personal purity, who will not settle
        for less than a temple marriage, and I will give you a young woman who
        will perform miracles for the Lord now and throughout eternity.”
        <i>-President Ezra Taft Benson, 13th President of the Church, 1985–94;
        (“To the Young Women of the Church,” Ensign, Nov. 1986, 84)</i></h5>

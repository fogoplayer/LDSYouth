            <ol>
                <li>You are a daughter of Heavenly Father, who knows you and loves you. Read <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/ps/8.4-6">Psalm 8:4–6</a>; <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/jer/1.5">Jeremiah 1:5</a>; <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/13.34">John 13:34</a>; <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/18.10">Doctrine and Covenants 18:10</a>; <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/abr/3.22-23">Abraham 3:22–23</a>; and <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.1-20">Joseph Smith—History 1:1–20</a>.

                </li>

                <li>Learn about the importance of patriarchal blessings by studying about them in <a href="https://www.lds.org/manual/true-to-the-faith/patriarchal-blessings?lang=eng">True to the Faith</a> and recent conference talks. Find out why they are given and who can give them. Discuss with a parent or Church leader how to prepare to receive a patriarchal blessing and how it can teach you of your worth and identity and be a guide throughout your life. If you have not received your blessing, prepare to receive it.

Do all you can to build others and make them feel of worth. Every day for two weeks notice the worthwhile qualities and attributes of others. Acknowledge them verbally or in writing. In your journal write what you have learned about the worth of individuals and how your own confidence grows when you build others.

            <ol start="4">
                <li>You are preparing now to fulfill a unique mission on the earth. Read <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.119">Doctrine and Covenants 88:119</a>. In your journal make a list of your hopes and dreams for your future home, family, and education and some important things you would like to accomplish in your life, including becoming a wife and mother. Then write a plan that will help you achieve your goals. Share this plan with a family member, leader, or friend.

                </li>

                <li>When you participate in family history, you come to understand your identity and individual worth. Visit with your living relatives to learn as much information about your family history as possible.

Ask a family member, a Young Women leader, and a friend to write down positive qualities the Lord has given you. List your gifts in your journal, and write how you can continue to develop these gifts and use them to serve your family and others.

            <p>After you have completed six individual worth value experiences, create a project that will help you practice what you have learned.

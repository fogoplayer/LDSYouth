            <h2>For The Strength Of Youth: Education</h2>

            <p>After you have begun working on your plans in “<a href="/LDSYouth/dutyToGod/teacher/teacherSS.html">Spiritual
        Strength</a>” and “<a href="/LDSYouth/dutyToGod/teacher/teacherPD.html">Priesthood Duties</a>,” create a project based on the standards in the “<a href="https://www.lds.org/youth/for-the-strength-of-youth/education">Education</a>” section of For the Strength of Youth. Use the steps on the following pages as a guide. Your project should be challenging and should include a significant time commitment. It should also be based on your own needs and interests. It should help you establish a pattern of lifelong learning.</p>

            <h4>Step One: Learn</h4>
            <p>To learn about the importance of gaining knowledge, study the section titled “
                <a href="https://www.lds.org/youth/for-the-strength-of-youth/education">Education</a>” in For the Strength of Youth and <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.77-80">Doctrine and Covenants 88:77–80</a>,
                <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.118">118</a>. Identify from these verses (a) what the Lord wants you to learn, (b) why He wants you to learn, and (c) how He wants you to approach learning. Read “<a href="/LDSYouth/dutyToGod/proclamationToTheWorld">The Family: A Proclamation to
        the World</a>,” and identify your role as a future husband and father.</p>
            <p>Write your answers to the following questions, and discuss them with your parents or quorum members:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>What are the benefits of gaining an education?
                </li>
                <li>How will gaining an education help you fulfill your priesthood duties (including as a missionary, as a husband, as a father, and in your service to others)?</li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Step 2: Create a Project</h4>
            <p>Create a project that will help you apply what you have learned about gaining an education. It should include two parts: (1) plans to gain an education and (2) plans to explore future occupation options. Have a parent or leader approve your project before you begin working on it. Here are some examples of things you could include in each part of your project:</p>

            <h5>Examples-Education</h5>
            <ol>
                <li>Make a list of things you do well in school. Then make a list of things you could do to be more successful in school. Do those things, and note the difference it makes in your performance, your attitude about school, and so on.</li>
                <li>Make a plan to gain an education or training. Consider including in your plan what schools you would like to attend or training you’d like to receive. Also include what you have to do to be admitted to your school or training program and what options exist to finance this education.</li>
                <li>Pick a topic you’re interested in that you aren’t learning in school, and research that topic independently. Share what you learn in a presentation or a written paper.</li>
            </ol>

            <h5>Examples-Occupation</h5>
            <ol>
                <li>Learn about occupations or careers that interest you. This might include touring job sites and interviewing people who work there.</li>
                <li>Visit a local LDS employment resource center, and talk to a staff member about some of the future occupations or careers you are considering. Ask him or her what you would need to do to get a job in those fields. Share what you learn in a quorum meeting or Mutual activity.</li>
                <li>If you have income, develop and follow a personal savings and spending plan. It should include paying tithing and saving money for a mission. Share your plan with your parents or quorum members</li>
            </ol>

            <h5>My Project</h5>
            <p>Regular Exercise</p>
            <div contentEditable="true" class="textArea" id="teacherFTSOY2"></div>
            <p>Nutrition</p>
            <div contentEditable="true" class="textArea" id="teacherFTSOY3"></div>

            <p>Approval of a Parent or Leader</p>
            <div contentEditable="true" class="textArea signoff" id="teacherFTSOYSignoff1"></div>
            <p>Estimated Date of Completion</p>
            <div contentEditable="true" class="textArea signoff" id="teacherFTSOYSignoff2"></div>
            <p>My Signature</p>
            <div contentEditable="true" class="textArea signoff" id="teacherFTSOYSignoff3"></div>
            <p>Date Completed</p>
            <div contentEditable="true" class="textArea signoff" id="teacherFTSOYSignoff4"></div>

            <h4>Step 3: Report Your Experiences</h4>
            <p>In the space below, write what you have learned from carrying out your project and how it has prepared you for your future responsibilities. Report on your experiences to your family or quorum members.</p>

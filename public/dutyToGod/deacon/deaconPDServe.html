        <h4>Learn</h4>
        <p>Write down what you learn about
        serving others from the following
        scriptures: <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/james/1.27">James 1:27</a>, <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/2.17">Mosiah 2:17</a>,
        and <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/18.8-10">Mosiah 18:8–10</a>. Talk with a
        parent or quorum leader about the
        relationship between being a priesthood
        holder and serving others</p>
        
        <div contentEditable="true" class="textArea" id="deaconPDServe1"></div>
        
        <p>Discuss with members of your quorum the opportunities
        you have to serve others (ask your bishop or quorum leaders
        for ideas). As an Aaronic Priesthood holder, you serve others
        by assisting your bishop or branch president in “administering
        temporal things” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107.68">D&C 107:68</a>). This may include caring
        for the poor and needy, cleaning the meetinghouse and
        grounds, gathering fast offerings, and fulfilling assignments
        from your quorum president. It could also include service
        projects you decide to do on your own</p>
        <p>List some specific things your quorum will do to give service.
        Also plan several things you will do on your own to
        give service, including service to members of your family</p>
        
        <h4>Act</h4>
        <p>My quorum’s plan to give service:</p>
        <div contentEditable="true" class="textArea" id="deaconPDServe1"></div>
        <p>My personal plan to give service: </p>
        <div contentEditable="true" class="textArea" id="deaconPDServe2"></div>
        
        <h4>Share</h4>
        <p>Share with a parent or quorum members
        some of your experiences serving
        others. For example, you could talk
        about how your service has affected
        you and the people you have served.</p>
